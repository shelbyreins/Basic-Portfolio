            <p>I am an online student, looking to build a career from home. I enjoy traveling, yoga, walks on the beach and coffee chats. My favorite animals are cats and dolphins. I move a lot, for example, I have moved 12 times in seven years. </p>
            <p>I am excited to learn more about coding because it has always caught my attention, when I first began college, I was a mathematics major but I shortly realized that the jobs were not quite my interest which is when I switched to Economics. Economics required a lot of math as well and I have always enjoyed the concept of math. After talking to people who work in software, they informed me that coding was a similar concept of mathematics but with more career options. So here I am.</p>
            <p>I thrive to succeed in this field and am looking for remote work. My background consists of managment which protrays my work ethic and the ability to work independetly.</p>
